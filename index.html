      <h3>
        <p>My lungs are black, my heart is pure</p>
        <p>My hands are scarred from nights before</p>
        <p>And my hair is thin and fallin' out of all the wrong places</p>
        <p>I am a little insecure</p>
        <p>My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue</p>
        <p>I bite my nails and tell the truth</p>
        <p>I go from thin to overweight day-to-day it fluctuates</p>
        <p>My skin is inked, but faded, too</p>
        <p>But she loves me, she loves me</p>
        <p>Why the hell she love me</p>
        <p>When she could have anyone else?</p>
        <p>Oh, you love me, you love me</p>
        <p>Why the hell d'you love me?</p>
        <p>'Cause I don't even love myself</p>
        <p>Baby, the best part of me is you</p>
        <p>Lately, everything's makin' sense, too</p>
        <p>Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you</p>
        <p>I overthink and still forgive</p>
        <p>I lose my phone and place my bets</p>
        <p>And I never catch the train on time, always thirty minutes behind</p>
        <p>Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet</p>
        <p>But you love me, you love me</p>
        <p>Why the hell you love me so</p>
        <p>When you could have anyone else?</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah</p>
        <p>He loves me, he loves me</p>
        <p>And I bet he never lets me go</p>
        <p>And shows me how to love myself</p>
        <p>'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you</p>
        <p>Whoa, lately, everything's makin' sense, too</p>
        <p>Baby, I'm so in love with you</p>
        <p>With you</p>
        <p>Baby, the best part of me is you</p>
        <p>Whoa, lately, everything's making sense, too</p>
        <p>Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you, oh</p>
        <p>Baby, I'm so in love with you, yeah, yeah</p>
        <p>Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you</p>
